# gp-calc
A basic and didactic Genetic Programming example, used for symbolic regression.

# About
I made this during my Master's degree studies to learn Genetic Programming. As such, it's very simple, canonical and not optimized at all. What it is is easy to understand and use (or it will be soon).

# TO-DO
- review and clean code
- add examples (objective functions)
- add "how to use"
- add a theory section to explain what is Genetic Programming and what is Symbolic Regression
